Hello world 👋

I am a really passionate individual, eager to learn every day. I started my journey as a Financial Auditor 🤵 then I moved to M&A 🔎 and after that I took a sabbatical 🕉️ When I came back I started as a Programmatic Trader 🔥 until I came across with programming.

After a test and learn period of +8 years, I feel extremely fortunate to have fallen in the software engineering rabbit hole 💻 a fast-paced industry ⚡ that is in constant change where I can challenge my analytical skills and my logic thinking on a daily basis.

I am genuinely grateful to Meditation for that since it has helped me dealing better with my emotions and the always present frustration, dissolve my ego (yet not completely, I need to keep practicing) and enjoy the everyday little accomplishments.
