Hello world 👋

I am a really passionate individual, eager to learn more and more every day. I started my journey as a Financial Auditor 🤵, then I moved to M&A 🔎 and after that I took a well-deserved sabbatical 🕉️ When I came back I became a Programmatic Trader 🔥 and, after a test and learn period of +8 years, I feel extremely fortunate to have fallen in the software engineering rabbit hole 💻; a fast-paced industry ⚡ that is in constant change, where I can easily measure the output of my work and where I can challenge my analytical skills and my logic thinking on a daily basis. I am genuinely grateful to Meditation and Bitcoin for that.

**Meditation** has helped me dealing better with my emotions and the always present frustration, dissolve my ego (yet not completely, I need to keep practicing) and enjoy the everyday little accomplishments.
 
**Bitcoin** has helped me by lowering my time preference and develop exponential thinking.
