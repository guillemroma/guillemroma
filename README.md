Hello world 👋

I am a really passionate individual, eager to learn every day. I started my journey as a Financial Auditor 🤵 I then switched to M&A 🔎 until I took a sabbatical 🕉️ When I came back, I started as a Programmatic Trader, but I came across with programming...

After a test and learn period of +8 years, I feel extremely fortunate to have fallen in the software engineering rabbit hole 💻 a fast-paced industry ⚡ that has exactly what I need:

1) Allows me to clearly measure the output of my work
2) Is constantly changing
2) Challenges my analytical skills and my logic thinking on a daily basis

I am genuinely grateful to Meditation for accompanying me along the journey, helping me deal with all the ups and downs as well as teaching me how to appreciate the everyday little accomplishments
